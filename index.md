# Introduction to Modeling the Dynamics of an Battery Electric Vehicle in C++

*DISCLAIMER: This blog series is based on publicly available knowledge and does
not use any proprietary information or algorithms from my current or past
employers. The content is solely for educational purposes.*

Welcome to this blog series where we’ll build a simple model of a battery
electric vehicle from scratch in C++ while using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
to. Whether you're an engineer, developer, or hobbyist, this series will help
you understand how to simulate dynamic systems in C++ and ditch tools like
Simulink for a flexible, code-first approach.

## What is a Vehicle Model?

## Why Test-Driven Development (TDD)?

## C++ as the Choice for Dynamic Systems

## Setup Development Environment
